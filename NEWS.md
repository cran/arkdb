# arkdb 0.0.4

- `unark()` will strip out non-compliant characters in table names by default.
- `unark()` gains the optional argument `tablenames`, allowing the user to
   specify the corresponding table names manually, rather than enforcing
   they correspond with the incoming file names. 
   [#18](https://github.com/ropensci/arkdb/issues/18)
-  `unark()` gains the argument `encoding`, allowing users to directly set
   the encoding of incoming files.  Previously this could only be set by
   setting `options(encoding)`, which will still work as well. See
  `FAO.R` example in `examples` for an illustration.  
- `unark()` will now attempt to guess which streaming parser to use 
   (e.g `csv` or `tsv`) based on the file extension pattern, rather than
   defaulting to a `tsv` parser.  (`ark()` still defaults to exporting in
   the more portable `tsv` format).
